# [Gibran-Rebranding-Uncensored](https://www.mudabicara.id/kajian/re-branding-gibran-dari-bagi-bagi-susu-hingga-jadi-youtuber-sorot-wacana/)

**Project**: A digital investigation into public perception of Gibran Rakabuming Raka's "re-branding" efforts.
In recent months, Gibran Rakabuming Raka has appeared more consistent as a content creator on YouTube â€” abandoning his "unique" and somewhat eccentric communication style and shifting to a more formal and serious approach. Content such as "Generasi Muda," "Demographic Bonus," and "The Future of Indonesia" are clear examples of this change.

Muda Bicara presents an analysis of netizen comments on these content: many support Gibran's efforts to appear more mature and focused, while some suspect this move is more of a political maneuver than a genuine change in character. Some praise the content for being more informative and educational, but many also feel the changes feel contrived, as if an attempt to "appear different" for the sake of image.
## Objectives
- Collect public comments from public platforms (YouTube) regarding Gibran's new videos and content.
- Conduct sentiment, framing, and word network analysis to observe netizen reaction patterns.
- Assess whether the re-branding received a positive, negative, or was perceived as a political maneuver.
